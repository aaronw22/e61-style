# Tests

This style guide does not go into detail about writing tests because it is merely a guide to style. To learn how to write good tests, read the [Testing chapter in R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/tests.html).

## Organisation

The organisation of test files should match the organisation of `R/` files: if a function lives in `R/foofy.R`, then its tests should live in `tests/testthat/test-foofy.R`. 

Use `usethis::use_test()` to automatically create a file with the correct name.

The file name will be displayed in output in order to get context.
